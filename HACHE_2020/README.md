# HACHE - 2020 WRITE-UP
Hache is a 36 hours long Capture The Flag Event where students of JUIT can participate.
Our aim is about spreading the importance of cybersecurity in today's community. Each and every person should be aware of different vulnerabilities in systems as well as how to protect onselves against cyber attacks We believe gamification is the best technique to teach oneself about cybersecurity.

The whole CTF was based on brooklyn nine-nine, (main plot)
